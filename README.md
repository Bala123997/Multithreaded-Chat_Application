Simple Multi-Threaded Chat Application (Java)

This is a simple *client-server chat application* built using Java sockets.  
It demonstrates how multiple clients can connect to a server and exchange messages with each other in real time using *multi-threading*.

 📌 Features
- Multi-threaded server that can handle multiple clients at the same time.
- Clients can send messages to the server.
- Server broadcasts messages to *all connected clients*.
- Runs on plain Java — no external libraries required.

⚡ Notes

Default port is 1234 (can be changed in code).

Run server first, then start clients.

Use Ctrl+C to stop the server or client.



📖 Concepts Used

Java Socket Programming

ServerSocket and Socket

InputStreamReader, BufferedReader, and PrintWriter

Multi-threading with Thread class

Broadcasting messages to multiple clients



✅ Future Improvements

Add client usernames.

Support private messaging.

Add GUI using Swing/JavaFX.

Handle client disconnection gracefully.
